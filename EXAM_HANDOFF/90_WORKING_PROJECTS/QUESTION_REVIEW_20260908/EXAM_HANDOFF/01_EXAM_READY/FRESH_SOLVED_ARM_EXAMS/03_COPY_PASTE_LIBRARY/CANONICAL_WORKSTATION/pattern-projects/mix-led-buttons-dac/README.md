# mix-led-buttons-dac

Compose a board monitor using LED, Buttons, DAC. INT0 toggles running and KEY1 selects the output mode. LEDs show the low eight bits. DAC holds a static voltage; this combination makes no audio-frequency claim. Inspect app, output_ticks and supervisor_ticks in the debugger for components without a visible output.

## Run and inspect

Reset: running=1, value=0. For available inputs: INT0 pauses; KEY2 resets; RIGHT increments; ADC 4095 sets value=255 and amplitude=1023. Release inputs between commands.

## Resource ownership

- P2.0–P2.7: board labels LD11–LD4; byte display mask
- P2.10 INT0, P2.11 KEY1, P2.12 KEY2; active low
- P0.26 / AOUT speaker; 0–1023; timed waveform with Timer1, static voltage otherwise
- Foreground: sole controller state owner; bounded FIFO of 31 usable snapshots; loss counter on overflow
